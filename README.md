# Gameception
Playing around with Open GL. This project was a really great way for me to learn some concepts in programming. What better way to learn than to apply it to something fun like video games.<br/> 
The files were compiled in xcode but should compile using any cpp<br />
compiler. Make sure all png's are in the same folder before compiling. <br />This project assumes you have Open GL already preinstalled.
